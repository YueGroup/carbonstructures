# carbonstructures

**Authors:** Anthony Dee and Nhi Nguyen  
**Description:** A Python package for generating and functionalizing carbon structures, with support for exporting to LAMMPS and XYZ formats.

## **Overview**

carbonstructures is a Python package designed to generate graphene-based carbon structures. It provides an interactive command-line interface (CLI) for defining structural parameters, applying functionalization, and exporting the final structure for molecular simulations.

---

## **Features**
- **Structure Generation:** Create various carbon structures, including graphene sheets, sandwiches, pistons, and carbon nanotubes.
- **Functionalization:** Apply functional groups to carbon structures with customizable patterns and coverage.
- **Export Capabilities:** Export generated structures in LAMMPS and XYZ file formats for use in external simulation tools.

---

## **Usage**
### **Running the Interactive Generator**
To start generating carbon structures, run the `generate.py` script:

```bash
cd src/carbonstructures
python generate.py
```

This will launch an interactive CLI where you can select the structure type, define parameters, apply functionalization, and export the final structure.
